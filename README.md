## How to Run the KIIT Clubs Project

### Step 1: Download the Project Files
1. Download the zip file containing the KIIT Clubs project from the provided source.
2. Save it to an easily accessible location on your system, such as the Desktop or Downloads folder.

### Step 2: Install XAMPP (Local Host Server)
1. Visit the [XAMPP website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and download the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Follow the installation instructions to install XAMPP on your system. This software package will allow you to run a local web server.

### Step 3: Start Apache and phpMyAdmin
1. Open the XAMPP Control Panel. You can find it in the installation directory or by searching for "XAMPP" on your system.
2. Click the "Start" button next to **Apache** to launch the web server. A green indicator should confirm that it is running.
3. Click the “Admin” button next to **MySQL** to open phpMyAdmin in your web browser. This tool allows you to manage your databases.

### Step 4: Upload Project Files to htdocs
1. Navigate to the XAMPP installation directory (usually located in C:\xampp for Windows).
2. Open the **htdocs** folder, where you will store your project files.
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of the downloaded project folder (from Step 1) into the **htdocs** directory. Ensure that the main files (like `index.html`, etc.) are directly accessible in the htdocs folder or within a subfolder as needed.

### Step 5: Import Database SQL Files into phpMyAdmin
1. In phpMyAdmin, create a new database by clicking on the "Databases" tab. Enter a name for your database (e.g., `club_registrations`) and click "Create."
2. Once the database is created, select it from the left sidebar.
3. Click on the "Import" tab, then choose the SQL file(s) you need to upload (usually included in your project zip file).
4. Click "Go" to import the database. This step sets up the necessary tables and data for the project.

### Step 6: Access the Project in Your Browser
1. Open your web browser and type the following URL in the address bar: `http://localhost/yourfolder/index.html` (replace `yourfolder` with the name of the project folder you placed in htdocs if applicable).
2. If you placed the files directly in htdocs, simply type `http://localhost/index.html`.

### Step 7: Enjoy Your Website!
You should now see the KIIT Clubs website in your browser. Explore the various features, register for clubs, and enjoy the enhanced student engagement experience!

If you encounter any issues, ensure that Apache and MySQL are running properly in the XAMPP Control Panel, and verify that you correctly imported the database.
